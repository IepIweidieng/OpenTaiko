Duration, unlike Beat, is the animation duration
measured in milliseconds for either a frame or the
whole animation. This category is most often used
in menus outside of gameplay, but does get used in
a few cases in gameplay such as Balloon popping.

Example :
Chara_Normal_AnimationDuration=500
Chara_Result_Clear_AnimationDuration=1000
