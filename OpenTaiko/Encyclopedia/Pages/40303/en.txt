Beat is used to control how fast your character is
animating, relative to the beat of the song you're
playing. The animation completes playing or looping
for once in the specified beat number, so a lower
number means it moves faster, while a higher number
means it moves slower.

Example :
Game_Chara_Beat_Normal=1
Game_Chara_Beat_GoGo=2
